# Clustering methods - comprehensive study

Clustering is one of the most frequently used forms of unsupervised learning. It automatically discover natural grouping in data.

Clustering is especially useful for exploring data you know nothing about. You might find connections you never would have thought of. Clustering can also be useful as a type of feature engineering, where existing and new examples can be mapped and labeled as belonging to one of the identified clusters in the data.

Some typical real world applications of clustering include fraud detection, categorizing books in a library or customer segmentation in marketing.
